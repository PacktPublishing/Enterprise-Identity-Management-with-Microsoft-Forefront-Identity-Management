## About the Video Course
Forefront Identity Manager is an Identity Management system, that helps you manage digital identities, enable restricted access permissions, provide self-service features, implement a complete IdM solution, and synchronize information between typical systems illustrated by an HR system and Active Directory.

In this video tutorial, we will follow a fictive company called “The Company”, as it implements a complete Identity Management solution, helping you to understand the implementation of an IdM solution based on FIM 2010 R2. We will go the whole nine yards, from installing FIM 2010 R2 to implementing synchronization, workflows, and self-service features.

Using FIM 2010 R2, The Company will help guide your efforts to modernize your Identity Management solution by showing you how to implement both automation and self-service functionality.

Using the HR system as a master system for users, The Company will be able to automate account management in their Active Directory. Adding self-service will help people help themselves by enabling them to be productive again, for example, if users forget their password or want to join groups without the need to call the helpdesk.

This video course will open your mind to the possibilities of FIM 2010 R2.
